# Tasks App

Tasks App is a sample Task Management app built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com). 

🚨 This app is under active development. 🚨

Much functionality is currently unavailable. `main` is considered stable, so you're free to clone and run it, but there's not much to do for now. We've developing it here in the open though, so feel free to follow along in the Pull requests and issues to get a sense for the decisions being made.

## Project Structure

### App code

This repository contains the Tasks App implemented in the *three* languages supported by our [Bolt Framework](https://api.slack.com/tools/bolt). For more details on each implementation, checkout the README.md in the respective folder

### App Manifest

The root of the repository also contains a `manifest.yml` file, which you can use to [configure your own instance](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) of the App.
