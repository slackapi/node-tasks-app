# Tasks App

Tasks App is a sample Task Management app built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com). 

ðŸš¨ This app is under active development. ðŸš¨

Much functionality is currently unavailable. `main` is considered stable, so you're free to clone and run it, but there's not much to do for now. We've developing it here in the open though, so feel free to follow along in the Pull requests and issues to get a sense for the decisions being made.
